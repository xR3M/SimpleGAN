# SimpleGAN

This code is intended to create a simple and function GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), which consists
of two neural networks (the Generator and the Discriminator) where the generator network works on trying
to fool the discriminator class by generating realistic images, and the discriminator's job is to identify
whether or not the image generated by the Generator network is real. Since the networks rely on 
eachother's output, this enables the model to learn in a unsupervised manner.

This code is written with the pytorch library and runs for 50 epochs on a MNIST (Modern National Institute of Standard and Technology) dataset, which consists of a database full of 
handwritten digits.

The Optimizer of choice is the Adam Optimizer as it is quite robust, combining both the RMSProp and Momentum optimizers.
